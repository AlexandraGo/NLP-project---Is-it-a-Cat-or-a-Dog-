# NLP project Is it a Cat or a Dog?

**Neural Networks Project that predicts if the image is a Cat or a Dog.**



In this project we try to predict whether the image is a cat or a dog. 
Our best model gives us an accuracy of 0.85% in the test data and 0/92% in training data.
We are aware that our model still has some overfitting, however not better results were achieved.

We have used the technique **Image Data Generator** to decrease our overfitting (which it did) **Image Data Generator** is a technique used to avoid overfitting  by expanding/alterating artifically our datset i.e: increase the scale of the pictures by 50 x 50, or rotate the images or cropping the pictures.
